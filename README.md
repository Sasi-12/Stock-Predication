#Stock-Predication

The project is to predict stock price movement using Pyspark on a distributed spark cluster. It creates a large -scale financial dataset's efficient processing and analysis on the powerful distributed computing model of the Apache sparks. For this, Aadhaar is a historical stock market data, which may include broad variables such as price, business versions and wide variables such as opening and closing. Data is pre-developed in Pyspark to ensure data cleaning, normalization and convenience extraction and relevance.A spark MLLIB-based machine learning pipeline classifies the direction in which the price of stock will use models like a certain time horizon for a certain time horizon (up or down) such as random forests, gradients, or models like logistic region . Hyperpieme tuning, in combination with cross-satyapan, is used to customize the model, and its performance is measured through accurate, recall and F1 score metrics. In addition, the project involves spark streaming for real -time predictions that allow you to monitor the trends of the stock market. The project displays the capacity of computing distributed in financial data analysis and gives groundwork for advanced trading and portfolio management systems.
