# Predicting Stock Price Movement with PySpark in Spark Cluster

- The project focuses on predicting stock price movement using PySpark within a distributed Spark cluster environment. It leverages Apache Spark's scalable computing capabilities to process and analyze large-scale financial datasets efficiently. Historical stock market data, including features like opening and closing prices, trading volumes, and technical indicators, forms the foundation of this analysis. The data undergoes preprocessing in PySpark, including cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction, to ensure quality and relevance. A machine learning pipeline is built using Spark MLlib, employing models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Logistic Regression to classify the stock price movement direction (up or down) over a specific time frame. The model is optimized using hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation, with performance evaluated through metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, the project integrates Spark Streaming for real-time predictions, providing live insights into stock market trends. This project demonstrates the potential of distributed computing in financial data analysis and lays the groundwork for advanced trading and portfolio management systems.
