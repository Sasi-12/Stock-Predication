This project is to predict stock price movement, using PySpark on a distributed Spark cluster. It builds on the powerful distributed computing model of Apache Spark to achieve efficient processing and analysis of massive financial datasets. The basis for this is historical stock market data, which may consist of extensive variables such as opening and closing prices, trade volumes, and technical indicators. Data cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction — data is pre-processed in PySpark to ensure quality and relevance.A Spark MLlib-based machine learning pipeline classifies the direction in which the stock price will progress (up or down) for a certain time horizon using models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Logistic Regression. Hyperparameter tuning, in combination with cross-validation, are utilized to optimize the model, and its performance is measured through precision, recall, and F1 score metrics. Furthermore, the project includes Spark Streaming for real-time predictions that allow you to monitor stock market trends. This project demonstrates the potential of distributed computing in financial data analysis and lays the groundwork for advanced trading and portfolio management systems.
